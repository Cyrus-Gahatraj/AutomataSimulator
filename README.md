# FiniteAutomataSimulator

A simple Java-based simulator for finite automata. It allows users to define states, transitions (edges), and labeled inputs between states. This tool can be useful for learning automata theory, simulating simple machines, or as a base for expanding into NFA/DFA simulation or regex parsing.

## 🚀 Features

- Create states and transitions
- Support for multiple labeled transitions between states
- Console output for transition visualization
- Easily extendable to support NFAs, DFAs, or visual representations

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Java 8 or higher** installed.

To check your Java version:

```bash
java -version
